# Project Overview
The Quiz App project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making your own Android app - taking it from the idea stage to building out the full app. You can share your app with family and friends, as well as with other students in this course.

The goal is to create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic of your choice. We want you to be creative about how you accomplish this. Itâ€™s up to you what the quiz questions will be about and how you want to present them to your user. (Per the rubric, we require a minimum of 4 questions and a maximum of 10 quiz questions for a proper app submission).
